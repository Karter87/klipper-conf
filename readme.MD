# Klipper 

## Motivation

During my studies in 2014, I build my first RepRap 3d Printer. 
Using Prusa's initial i3 design. Only the RAMPS-1.4 and Steppermotors was bought. 

The materials I scattered in the workshop of ForZe where I used a MAHO CNC capable mill,
which I hacked the serial bus to be able to connect it to a CAM software packet.

The printer was running repetier firmware and printed 3 other printers. 
The last one being a Prusa i3 MK3 Clone with Bear modification. (Re)building often the firmware with Marlin-2.x bugfix branch.

When I started with Klipper3D, I missed the default Config approach of Marlin.
